		<h2> BAG ADDICTED :Â what is purse obsession </h2>
		<h3> Healthy sickness, it's possible ! 
 </h3>
		<p> Shopoholic, so buying a lots of new bags can cost you a lot of money, I admit. But this can also help you earn money, if you do enough research, invested in classic pieces, and buying in correct time and selling in correct time and place can help you earn per 1 purse same as like other people earned 1 month salary. Lets me tell me something I didnt know when I started with this obsession.  </p></div>

  <h2>Should you trust your instinct? Listen to ur heart? </h2>
  <p><br> If you walked into the store and instanty you fall in love with beautiful purse in display, your all heart sing Oh my god i need it in my life - hold on. Dont do it. Dont buy anything without research just only because you love it. Check the price on the resell market, it gives you basic info of how much it hold it value. Dont follow any trend, trend bag next season will drop price and you wont be able to sell them, unlike the classic pieces, whose are always highly demanded even after many years, just their price will be higher, because there is always so many people wanting them"

<h2>Why do you buy a same bag ? is it really same?</h2> <br>

<p> "I wish I knew those things before I have lost thousand of euros on the bad investment purchase. Happy to share with you my experience which I gained during last few years. <br>
		  First of all, remember 3 magic trio : Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton. They never go on sale, not even one euro, not even 1 cent. This is their company policies , all kind of discount is forbidden. Their price increase at least once, or twice a year, so you can go ahead and invest on them. Other brand (even more expensive, or same exclusive) - dont buy full prices, cause they will probably go on sale for 80% cases." <a href="http://grechenscloset.com/minimal-closet-buying-multiples/">read more...</a></p></div>
